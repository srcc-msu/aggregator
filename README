*****************
*** Compiling ***
*****************

Requires gcc version, that supports c++11. Tested with gcc version 4.6.3

$ make

It builds required agregator library, builds proxy and csv_writer component

if you have gcc installed localy, use CXX var to locate it 

$make CXX=~/bin/g++

*********************
*** Configuration ***
*********************

All aggregator config is located in proxy/aggregator.conf

server.address - local address, where aggregator starting. must belong to the same interface, where agents are
server.queue.delta - how much the sensor must change to show it. 0.1 = 10% change from last value
server.queue.interval - interval, after which the sensor value will be sent regardless of its value
server.buffer.sensors - list of sensors, that will be stored in memory for 300 seconds and availiable for \sensorstats request

agents.list - list of agent, that will be inited on loading. adding new agent can be done manually by changes or by restarting the aggregator

***************
*** Running ***
***************

Proxy server takes two params:
1st - path to a file, where the control socket will be created
2nd - path to the config file.

$ cd proxy
$ bin/holang_proxy.rb /tmp/proxy ./aggregator.conf


csv_writer takes 3 params:
1st - path to the proxy control socket (see above)
2nd - path to own socket, where it will read data from; this path will be provided to the proxy in control message
3rd - pah to the config file

$ cd csv_writer
$ bin/holang_proxy.rb /tmp/proxy /tmp/writer ./writer.conf

*************
*** Usage ***
*************

rm /tmp/proxy; screen -d -m bin/proxy /tmp/proxy cfg/graphit.cfg
