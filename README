*****************
*** Compiling ***
*****************

Requires gcc version, that supports c++11. Tested with gcc version 4.6.3

$ make

It builds required agregator library, builds proxy and csv_writer component

if you have gcc installed localy, use CXX var to locate it 

$make CXX=~/bin/g++

*********************
*** Configuration ***
*********************

All aggregator config is located in proxy/aggregator.conf

server.address - local address, where aggregator starting. must belong to the same interface, where agents are
server.queue.delta - how much the sensor must change to show it. 0.1 = 10% change from last value
server.queue.interval - interval, after which the sensor value will be sent regardless of its value
server.buffer.sensors - list of sensors, that will be stored in memory for 300 seconds and availiable for \sensorstats request

agents.list - list of agent, that will be inited on loading. adding new agent can be done manually by changes or by restarting the aggregator

*** Running ***

*** Usage ***
*************

By defaul server listens on 9293 port

To get data: create new session with any id, for example 123456

$ curl localhost:9293/session/new?sessid=123456
$ curl localhost:9293/stream?sessid=123456

!!! only id is allowed for now and currently checked to be registered earlier ^^


!!!
!!! next section is not wroking in current release:
!!!

To get data from the buffer:
 
$ curl 'localhost:9293/sensorstats?ip=10.0.0.1&sensor=1053&from=30' # last 30 seconds
$ curl 'localhost:9293/sensorstats?ip=10.0.0.2&sensor=1051&from=2m' # last 2 mins = 120 seconds
